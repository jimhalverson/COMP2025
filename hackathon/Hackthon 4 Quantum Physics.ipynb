Try it in this hackathon but *do not use CoPilot* because it's easy enough to do without it and it would be closer in spirit to what might be on a quiz at the end of the month.\n",

    "*Abstract:* Study the quantum analog of a classical billiard system. Implement the Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle confined in a 2D billiard table with various boundary shapes. While it may sound relatively benign, the uncertainty in the quantum wavefunction and the boundary conditions of the billiards table can take a mundane initial wavefunction to something truly beautiful. So solve for the wavefunction, and make it as easy as possible to change the geometry of the billiard table. Start with ellipsoidal boundary conditions and see what changes as you change the eccentricity. If you have time, try more complicated shapes like a stadium or a Sinai billiard."
